The sliders allow you to adjust the frequency of the underlying periodic sine wave signal (represented by `frequency`), and also how often the signal is sampled (represented by `grid_points`). Get it wrong, and a high-frequency sine wave is measured as a lower-frequency signal."}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "To see the effects of aliasing:\n\n1.
